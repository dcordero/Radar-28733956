# tvOS-AVPlayerViewController-Bug
Project created to report bug on AVPlayerViewController


# Description
When a very long description is provided on AVMetadataCommonIdentifierDescription, AVPlayerViewController allows expanding the description in a separated ViewController. 

This modal ViewController is presented modally and when is presented the player on the background is paused.

# Expected 
AVPlayerViewController continues playing on the background while the full description is presented modally.

# Steps
